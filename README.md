A (reasonably) unopinionated Gatsby starter, including; Tailwind 2 and
Emotion. Use Tailwind utilities with Emotion powered CSS-in-JS to
produce component scoped CSS (no need for utilities like Purge CSS,
etc).

## 🧪 Installation

To install, run;

```
gatsby new gatsby-site https://github.com/chrish-d/gatsby-starter-tailwind2-emotion-styled-components
```

## 🐞 Bugs

- No support for Tailwind Plugins.
